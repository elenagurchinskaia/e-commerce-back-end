## Description

This project involves building a functional Express.js API with a MySQL database backend, seamlessly connected using Sequelize. By configuring environment variables for the database name, MySQL username, and password, the application establishes a connection to the database. Running schema and seed commands results in the creation of a development database populated with test data.

Upon starting the application, the server initializes, and the Sequelize models are synchronized with the MySQL database. The API includes GET routes for categories, products, and tags, which can be tested using tools like Insomnia Core. The data fetched from these routes is presented in a well-formatted JSON structure.

Furthermore, the API offers functionality for POST, PUT, and DELETE routes through which data manipulation is achieved. Testing these routes within Insomnia Core enables successful creation, updating, and deletion of data in the connected MySQL database. In summary, this project provides a robust and user-friendly API that facilitates database interactions and data management tasks.
